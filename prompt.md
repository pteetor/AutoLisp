Read the file `project.md` and the file `README.md`, then write any questions
you have about this project to the new file `questions.md` in Markdown format.
Be comprehensive.
After you write the questions to the file, I will update this document
and other documents to answer your questions and give you more context.
Do not write any code yet.
